description: Interview the user about a spec
agent: plan
---

Read this plan file $1 and interview me in detail using the about literally
anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make
sure the questions are not obvious.

Be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it’s complete,
then write the spec to the file.
