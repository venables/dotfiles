$1 If you were to break this project down into sprints and tasks, how would you
do it (timeline info does not need included and doesnt matter) - every
task/ticket should be an atomic, commitable piece of work with tests (and if
tests don't make sense another form of validatation that it was completed
successfully), every sprint should result in a demoable piece of software that
can be run, tested, and build ontop of previous work/sprints. Be exhaustive, be
clear, be technical, always focus on small atomic tasks that compose up into a
clear goal for the sprint. Once you're done, provide this prompt to a subagent
to review your work and suggest improvements. When you're done reviewing the
suggest improvements write your tasks/tickets, sprint plans, etc to a md file.
