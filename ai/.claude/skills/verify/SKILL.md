# Verification Loop Skill

A comprehensive verification system for Claude Code sessions.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill:

- After completing a feature or significant code change
- Before creating a PR
- When you want to ensure quality gates pass
- After refactoring

## Verification Phases

### Phase 1: Run checks

```bash
# For bun / typescript projects
bun run check 2>&1 | tail -20

# Projects with a Makefile
make check
```

If checks fail, STOP and fix before continuing.

### Phase 2: Security Scan

```bash
# Check for secrets
grep -rn "sk-" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" . 2>/dev/null | head -10
grep -rn "api_key" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" . 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Check for console.log
grep -rn "console.log" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" src/ 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

### Phase 3: Diff Review

```bash
# Show what changed
git diff --stat
git diff HEAD~1 --name-only
```

Review each changed file for:

- Unintended changes
- Missing error handling
- Potential edge cases

## Output Format

After running all phases, produce a verification report:

```
VERIFICATION REPORT
==================

Build:     [PASS/FAIL]
Types:     [PASS/FAIL] (X errors)
Lint:      [PASS/FAIL] (X warnings)
Tests:     [PASS/FAIL] (X/Y passed, Z% coverage)
Security:  [PASS/FAIL] (X issues)
Diff:      [X files changed]

Overall:   [READY/NOT READY] for PR

Issues to Fix:
1. ...
2. ...
```

## Continuous Mode

For long sessions, run verification every 15 minutes or after major changes:

```markdown
Set a mental checkpoint:

- After completing each function
- After finishing a component
- Before moving to next task

Run: /verify
```
