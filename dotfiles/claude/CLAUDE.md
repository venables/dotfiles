## Communication Style

When interacting directly with the user:

- **Prioritize concision over perfect grammar** (maintain clarity)
- **List unresolved questions** at end under **Questions:** header if any exist
- **Use direct, technical language** without preamble
- **Never use emojis** in responses, code, commits, or documentation
